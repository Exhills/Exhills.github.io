            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Heya there! I go by <b>Exhils</b>, and I enjoy watching Anime, Listening to Music, and playing games.</p>
            <p>My favorite animes would be (in order), <b>The Ancient Magus' Bride (S1-S2P2)</b>, <b>Darling in the FranXX</b>, <b>Tokyo Ghoul (S1-S3)</b>, <b>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999</b>, <b>Sword Art Online (S1-S4)</b>, <b>I Want to Eat Your Pancreas</b>, There are plenty more, but there's a few! If you want to see all of the animes I've watched, scroll down for my <b>Anilist</b> profile.</p>
            <p>I don't really have any favorite games, but I do like to play <b>Warframe</b>, <b>Subnautica (+Below Zero)</b>, <b>Raft</b>, and other Survival Games that are like Raft, Green Hell, Sons Of The Forest, Stranded Deep, and others.</p>
            <p>I can't list all of my favorite music, so I linked a playlist named "favorites" in the "Other Links" below!</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I don't really have much experience with program development or 'coding' in general, the most I have done is create a front and backend from some random-ass discord bot I made out of pure boredom, which was completely and utterly impossible to manage for me due to the amount of code I fucked up.</p>
            <p>Put simply, I'm a rookie through-and-through. Still learning, through!</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I would say I have skill with hand drawing, as in drawing on real pieces of paper. I am also good with Digital art and adore artists who do digital art, it is extremely pretty.</p>
            <p>Also, I like to think I learn easily and have a knack for FPS, Survival, Puzzle/Escape, and Comp games.</p>
